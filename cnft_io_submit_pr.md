## How to add your policy to CNFT.io

### Data you will need
1. policy id 
2. project name 
3. twitter link 
4. website link


### Important information 
1. Policy you are using shouldn't be set to expire in a very long time. The idea that the policy should be used for minting a single project and shouldn't be used for multiple project. Make sure your policy is at least 2 months old.

2. File Name generally shouldn't contain any spaces. In linux OS it's preferable not to use spaces in filenames. Rather than space ethier use CamelCase for example MyAmazingProjcet instead of `my amazing project`.

3. Project names (inside the json) can contain spaces. 

4. In order for the team to ensure you are who you say you are, you need to show in your Social media account and in your webiste the policy-id you claiming. Image here to show an example website. 

5. To make it easier for CNFT team to review your PR make sure you include the links to your social media, link to your webiste policy-id page, 

6. If you are going to create new policy, make sure you update the same file. Files can include multiple policies. For example for Early Bird Token we have a policy-id that is different than Season 1 policy. In order to make it easier for the team to review I created both in the same file.
